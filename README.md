# Mirror Buddy

## Purpose
The purpose of this is to pull all of the mirror urls from mirrors.opensuse.com and ping them to find out which mirror would be best for you. 

## Things That Need Work
I currently have the pulling the mirrors from the mirrors page working but haven't been able to get the ability to ping all of the /n
mirror links to work. That is still a work in progress.
